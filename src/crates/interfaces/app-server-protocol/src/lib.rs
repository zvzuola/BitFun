//! Behavior-light wire contracts for BitFun App Server clients and hosts.
//!
//! This crate intentionally has no dependency on Core, Runtime implementations,
//! services, product assembly, or a UI framework. Server adapters translate
//! these wire DTOs to owner types at the interface boundary.
//! Wire schemas live under [`schemas`] and are grouped into modules named after
//! their JSON-RPC method domain; shared event envelopes remain in
//! [`schemas::event`].
