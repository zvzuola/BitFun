//! Session context compression modules.

//! NOTE: The earlier `microcompact` pre-compression layer (which silently
//! erased the contents of older tool results to free tokens) has been
//! removed.  It mutated already-sent message prefixes — invalidating provider
//! KV caches on every pass — and stripped the model of memory of what it had
//! already done, which directly drove repetitive tool-call loops in long
//! exploratory subagents.  Token pressure is now handled by the AI-summary
//! based full-context compression in `compressor.rs` and, as a final
//! safety-net only, the `emergency_truncate_messages` path in
//! `execution_engine.rs`.
