   *
   * A plain scroller preserves `scrollTop`, which anchors the *top* edge: the
   * bottom is where content gets revealed or swallowed. For a transcript that
   * is backwards — the interesting end is the bottom — so this anchors there
   * instead. Follow output already behaves this way for a viewport it owns;
   * this is the same rule for one it does not.
   *
   * The two halves are not equally capable, and the difference is worth
   * knowing:
   *
   * - **A height change moves no content.** Preserving `scrollTop +
   *   clientHeight` is therefore exact and needs no judgement about what the
   *   user was doing. It also preserves the distance to the content end, so a
   *   viewport that was at the end stays at the end for free. Growing the
   *   viewport is additionally a restoration: the browser used to clamp a
   *   bottom-anchored viewport at `scrollHeight - clientHeight`, and the
   *   resident spacer removed that clamp.
   * - **A width change reflows the transcript.** Where the line that was on the
   *   bottom edge went is a DOM question, and by the time a resize is observed
   *   the reflow has already happened — answering it would mean sampling an
   *   element anchor on the scroll path. The end of the transcript is the one
   *   position that can be recomputed from geometry, so that case is handled
   *   and the general one is not.
   *
   * Never animated. A height change moves the viewport by exactly the height
   * that was added or removed, so nothing appears to move at all; the rest is a
   * correction the user is already watching happen under their cursor.
   * Ownership does not change either: a gesture ending in the blank expresses
   * an intent to be at the end, a layout change expresses nothing.
