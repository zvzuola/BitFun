# FlowChat Scroll Stability

FlowChat reserves a resident tail spacer below the transcript, and pairs it with
a follow target that does not move backwards for free. Together these give a
newly submitted Turn a one-shot reveal with room below it and keep a tool-card
collapse from dragging earlier content down.

That is this document. Four siblings carry the rest.

## Which Document

| Changing | Read |
|---|---|
| the tail spacer, the follow target, new-Turn reveal, holding, resizing, the footer | this file |
| history paging, the prepend, the viewport anchor, history presentation | `FLOWCHAT_HISTORY_PAGING.md` |
| anything that writes `scrollTop`, one-shot navigation, the diagnostic trail | `FLOWCHAT_VIEWPORT_REGISTER.md` |
| the virtualizer, item measurement, item keys, anything a row renders | `FLOWCHAT_VIRTUALIZATION.md` |
| what to run before claiming it works | `FLOWCHAT_VERIFICATION.md` |

*Known Gaps* below is the whole list for all five — accepted defects are easier
to keep in one place than to hunt for.

## The Rule That Matters

**Static reservation is allowed. Reactive compensation is not.**

The tail spacer's height is a function of the viewport and the input-stack
inset. It must never be derived from a measured content height, a collapse
delta, an animation duration, or a streaming rate. The moment its height reacts
to content, it stops being a reservation and becomes the compensation engine
that was removed in "remove synthetic tail-space scrolling" — do not rebuild
that under a new name.

## How Much To Reserve

The input-stack footer and spacer together occupy at most three quarters of the
viewport:

```text
tailSpacerPx = max(0, round(clientHeight * 0.75 - bottomInsetPx))
```

At the physical bottom this leaves at least one quarter of the viewport showing
transcript content. For an 800px viewport and a 168px footer, the spacer is
432px and 200px of transcript remains visible. An expanded composer consumes
the reservation first; the spacer never becomes negative.

`hold-tail` still needs its collapse allowance to exist inside the physical
scroll range, so its effective maximum is the smaller of 60% of the viewport
and the rendered spacer. This makes the reservation the hard bound rather than
silently asking the browser to hold an offset it must clamp.

## Why Both Halves Are Required

The spacer alone fixes nothing. It only removes the browser's forced `scrollTop`
clamp when content shrinks, which is *permission* to hold position. A follow
target that re-aligns the content end to the viewport bottom every frame will
still drag earlier content down by the collapse delta, spacer or not.

`flowChatTailFollow.ts` supplies the second half: `hold-tail` keeps its previous
offset when content shrinks, and gives ground
  only once the blank below the live output exceeds `tailHoldMaxGapPx`
  (a share of the viewport capped by the physical spacer, not a measured delta).

These rules are pure functions over geometry. They hold no timers and observe
no mutation.

`useFlowChatFollowOutput` is the only continuous outer viewport writer. Three
things about how it runs are load-bearing:

- **`scheduleFollowToLatest` re-asserts ownership after a layout change but does
  not force the content end.** A collapse resizes content too, and the hold rule
  is what keeps that from moving the viewport.
- **A new Turn reveal runs no follow frame.** It places the viewport at the
  physical bottom once and samples only whether streamed output has consumed
  the blank.
- **When streaming stops, `hold-tail` settles any remaining blank with one
  smooth scroll.** A short new-Turn reveal remains at its reveal position.

`tailHoldMaxGapPx` is a **streaming allowance**. Blank below the live output is
tolerable only because more output is about to fill it. Do not reuse it to
absorb anything else — applied to a foreign forward move it parks the content
end mid-viewport permanently, since nothing pulls the target back down.

## Opening a Session

A session mounts against an unsettled transcript: item heights are still
estimates, and an `isPartial` session pages older Turns in for hundreds of
milliseconds. The end of content can travel thousands of pixels after the first
alignment, so opening is its own phase with its own rules.

**While opening, the transcript is hidden and the follow target is
authoritative.** It tracks the content end exactly — no remembered offset, no
gap tolerance, and no accommodation of a foreign `scrollTop` write. The
virtualizer writes during this window too, as items measure and it corrects for
the ones above the viewport; fighting it is invisible because nothing is
painted, and accommodating it would be permanent once paging stops.

Nothing places the opening viewport by aligning to an item. The end of *real
content* is above the resident tail spacer, and no item knows where that is, so
the follow target writes the offset and the reveal waits for it.

Session open enters follow-output as `session-open`, even with nothing
streaming. The frame loop then runs on a `SETTLE_FRAMES` budget that refreshes
whenever the target actually moves, so it tracks measurement and paging and then
goes quiet. Without it nothing owns the viewport after the one-shot alignment,
and the transcript strands wherever that early shot landed. `scrollToTurnEnd`
deliberately does **not** exit follow-output for the same reason: it is the
session-open placement and wants the same position the settle is converging on,
and releasing ownership there hands the viewport back to nobody.

**After the reveal, the follow target is cooperative.** The gap tolerance
applies again, because from then on a shrinking content end means a card
collapsed, not that measurement is still catching up.

The reveal waits for a *semantic* signal — the last virtual item rendered with
its end inside the viewport, plus the viewport in position — not for geometry to
stop changing. Before the virtualizer renders anything, `scrollHeight` and the
end sit unchanged at their unmeasured values, which is indistinguishable from
having finished; a stability test reveals on frame 3 and shows the whole settle.

## Revealing a New Turn

A newly submitted Turn does not enter continuous follow immediately. Once that
Turn exists in the live-tail projection, follow-output performs one placement at
the **physical bottom** (`scrollHeight - clientHeight`). That exposes the whole
resident spacer at once. The reveal then keeps viewport ownership, but runs no
RAF scroll writer:

```text
idle -> revealing-tail -> following-tail
```

As output streams, `scrollTop` stays fixed while `contentEndScrollTop` rises, so
the visible blank shrinks naturally. The transcript history therefore stays
still; content consumes the blank instead of a follow write moving history up.
When `blankPx = scrollTop - contentEndScrollTop` crosses from positive to zero,
the existing `content-caught-up` path enters ordinary `hold-tail` without a
one-shot correction. Subsequent growth follows normally.

A short response may never consume the blank. That is intentional: the reveal
position remains, and stopping streaming does not settle it. A user gesture
releases reveal ownership and opens the ordinary user-departure watch. A delayed
`jump-to-latest` from presentation restoration is ignored while reveal is
active, because the reveal already is the latest placement.

The arrival can precede the live-tail projection that renders it, especially
when submission starts from a history window. `pendingNewTurnIdRef` preserves
that arrival and retries the same one-shot placement when the presentation next
changes; it does not substitute the old content end.

## User-Controlled Reserved Blank

The spacer is bounded by the three-quarter reservation the user can scroll into.
Once a reader exits follow-output, their own scroll position is preserved even
when it lands in the blank. There is no `scrollend` correction or quiet-period
fallback that takes the viewport back. Explicit actions such as opening a
session, submitting a new Turn, navigating a Turn, rolling back, or choosing
jump-to-latest remain the ways to re-enter follow-output.

The remaining follow rules carry the live-tail design:

**The target is the follow target, never unconditionally the content end.** A
held collapse gap is a legitimate offset up to `tailHoldMaxGapPx` past the
content end; judged against the content end it would read as an overshoot and
fight the hold rule on every collapse. Once a user takes over, ordinary resume
starts from live geometry because the offset the hold rule protected no longer
belongs to follow-output.

## Output Catching Up With a Reader in the Blank

This watch covers the reader who scrolled up out of the tail but is still
looking at reserved blank, and whom output then overtakes.

Scrolling up gives the follow away permanently, and that is right only for a
reader who left the live region. A small scroll up may not have. The blank is up
to `tailHoldMaxGapPx` under `hold-tail` and starts at the whole spacer during a
new-Turn reveal, so the reader can be a few hundred pixels off the tail with
nothing hidden from them at all — until output grows past the bottom edge, and
they silently stop seeing it with no affordance saying so.

So a watch runs for as long as the reader holds the viewport — from the scroll
that took it to whatever hands it back. `scrollTop > contentEnd` is the
predicate for "the blank is on screen". The watch keeps one bit between
samples: whether the blank was on screen at the previous one. A crossing is that
bit going from set to clear, and which side moved decides who keeps the viewport
(`resolveTailDepartureCrossing`):

- **`content-caught-up`** — the content end rose further than the reader moved.
  Output filled the space under someone who was standing still, so follow takes
  the viewport back.
- **`reader-left-blank`** — the reader moved further than the content end rose.
  They went to read history, and are left alone. The latch clears, so nothing
  asks again until they put the blank back on screen themselves.

A crossing does **not** end the watch. Scoping it to one was tried and is wrong:
a reader who climbs out of the blank, reads for a while and scrolls back down to
sit in it again is in exactly the position the rule exists for, and had already
spent the single crossing they were given. The watch also opens on any exit that
finds none open, not only the one that took the follow — every wheel notch
exits, and only the first of them finds anything to give up.

Streaming does not stop because the reader scrolled, so both sides usually move
between samples and the tie-break above is doing real work. Two guards keep it
honest:

**A live gesture vetoes the resume.** Measured over one session's twenty
departures: nine left blank on screen, and two of those ended `content-caught-up`
— one a reader who had been still for 1.6s and was overtaken, one 320ms into a
live gesture with the reader climbing 200px while content grew 237. The
tie-break called the second for the content, correctly, and acting on it would
have taken the viewport back mid-scroll. `user-gesture` on the register
separates them, because a wheel claim lapses `USER_DRIVEN_SCROLL_WINDOW_MS`
after the last notch and notches arrive faster than that. A veto *defers* the
crossing rather than settling it — the latch stays set, so the next sample
judges the same transition again: a reader who carries on climbing out-moves the
content and is let go by a verdict that never needed the veto, and one who has
stopped is followed as soon as the claim lapses.

**Geometry read from two moments is not geometry.** `scrollTop` is clamped to
`scrollHeight - clientHeight`, so no settled viewport is more than the spacer
past the content end (`isTailBlankMeasurable`). A larger reading means the
transcript is mid-restructure: a history prepend shifts the viewport by the
height it inserted before that height is in the scroll range, and the blank
between the two reads as thousands of pixels. Measured on a session that paged
its whole history on the first scroll up — 14252px of shift against a content
end still reading 989, a blank of 6239px. Read at face value that is a reader
deep in the blank, which is the one state this acts on, so the next sample would
have pulled them out of the history they had just asked for. Such a sample takes
no verdict and does not touch the latch: a restructure says nothing about where
the reader was standing before it.

Resuming does not scroll. The blank closing *is* the two offsets meeting, so
what remains is one sample of growth, and the follow loop's ease covers it; a
one-shot scroll here would be a snap the reader can see for a correction they
cannot. A reveal uses the same crossing before any gesture, while a gesture
replaces it with the reader-owned form of the watch.

The whole watch is a ref. `followOutput.tailWatch` and
`followOutput.tailWatchEnded` bracket it — the second carrying `crossings`, so a
watch that never resolved anything can be told from one that resolved against
the reader — and `followOutput.tailCrossing` records each transition with its
verdict, both raw deltas, and whether a gesture was live.

## The Follow Eases Its Write, Never Its Target

The follow target moves when the transcript reflows, and Markdown reflows a
line at a time. A loop that assigns the target outright therefore spends 24px
on one frame out of seven and nothing on the other six, which is what a reader
reports as the output jumping rather than scrolling. `flowChatTailEase.ts`
spends the same distance over all seven.

It buys latency, not speed. Under steady growth the eased offset settles where
its per-frame catch-up equals the growth, so the visible step converges on *the
content's growth per frame* whatever the fraction is; smoothing spreads a lumpy
motion evenly across frames it already had. What `TAIL_EASE_ALPHA` actually
sets is how far behind the tail the offset rides, and that lag is what has to be
given back when the stream stops.

**Only the write is eased.** `followStateRef` still holds the offset the rule
owns, so the settle budget and the at-tail band both keep reading
a target rather than a position in transit. An ease that leaked into the target
would make every one of them chase the lag.

Four boundaries, and none of them is a matter of taste:

- **Past `TAIL_EASE_SNAP_ABOVE_PX` it jumps.** The first frame of an ease covers
  a quarter of the distance, so beyond four lines the ease's *opening step* is
  already bigger than the jump it set out to replace.
- **A target above the current offset is never eased.** That is content getting
  shorter — a card collapsing, a table reflowing — and easing down through it
  reads as the transcript being clawed backwards.
- **Not while the transcript is opening.** There the target is authoritative and
  nothing is painted, so an ease is travel nobody can see, holding open the one
  phase whose whole point is to end. The reveal is watching for the viewport to
  reach the content end.
- **An ease in flight keeps the loop alive.** The settle budget is refreshed by
  the *target* travelling, so without this a correction arriving on the last
  budgeted frame would be abandoned partway. It terminates on its own: the ease
  halves what is left every frame, and a write the register refuses moves
  nothing and so books no further frame.

A step of the list's own scroll offset changes no layout, and the worry that it
would still be charged for — the virtualizer re-windows from the scroll events
it produces, and each one is also an anchor carry and a visible-Turn pass — did
not show up in the measurement. Over 1580 steps and 8435px of following, list
commits held between 15/s and 28/s while the step rate varied from 29/s to
119/s, so the cost per step *falls* as the follow gets busier. The two highest
commit rates in the session, 46/s and 51/s, were windows where the list follow
took no step at all and a thinking card was growing instead. Commits track
content changing height, which is also what moves the follow target, and the
+0.80 correlation between the two is that shared cause rather than a price.

What the ease actually did, over the same run: no step over a line that was not
a deliberate snap, 99% of steps under 12px, 67% under 4px, and every window's
largest step exactly `TAIL_EASE_ALPHA` of its largest lag — 0.242 to 0.261
against a nominal 0.25, which is also the evidence that nothing else was
writing the viewport in between.

"At bottom" is a band, not a point: from the end of real content down to
whatever the follow rule owns. A reveal position and a held collapse gap are
inside it while follow-output owns them, so neither raises the jump-to-latest
affordance; reader-owned reserved blank is outside it. No virtualizer-reported
"at bottom" can express this: the end of the scroll range is the bottom of the
reserved blank, not the end of content.

The band is recomputed on scroll, on resize, **and when follow ownership
changes** — its lower edge is the follow target, which can move while the
viewport is perfectly still. A delayed jump to latest during a reveal writes
nothing at all. Driving the band from scroll events alone left the affordance
visible over a viewport that was at the tail, and clicking it then had nothing
to do — an inert button is worse than a missing one.

**A follow the frame loop is still correcting is inside the band by
definition.** The eased write rides behind the offset it owns, so a burst of
two or three lines would otherwise drop the viewport out of the band for a few
frames and flash the affordance over a transcript that is following the newest
output. Ownership cannot express this: it outlives the loop deliberately, and a
viewport resting in the reserved blank is an intentional reader-controlled
state. A gesture stops the loop before it can hide anything, and no later settle
step reclaims the viewport.

## Resizing Anchors the Viewport Bottom

A plain scroller preserves `scrollTop` across a resize, which anchors the **top**
edge — the bottom is where content gets revealed or swallowed. For a transcript
that is backwards, because the interesting end is the bottom.
`handleViewportResize` anchors there instead. Follow output already behaves this
way for a viewport it owns; this is the same rule for one it does not, so the
same drag stops producing two different results depending on whether the user
had scrolled.

The two halves are not equally capable, and the difference is the useful part:

- **A height change moves no content.** Preserving `scrollTop + clientHeight` is
  exact and needs no judgement about what the user was doing, so it is applied
  unconditionally. It also preserves the distance to the content end, which
  makes "was at the end, stays at the end" fall out for free rather than being a
  case. Growing the viewport is additionally a *restoration*: the browser used
  to clamp a bottom-anchored viewport at `scrollHeight - clientHeight`, and the
  resident spacer removed that clamp.
- **A width change reflows the transcript.** Where the line that was on the
  bottom edge went is a DOM question, and by the time the resize is observed the
  reflow has already happened, so it cannot be answered after the fact.
  Answering it would mean sampling an element anchor on the scroll path, which
  is a `getBoundingClientRect` per scroll event. Instead only the one position
  that can be recomputed from geometry is restored — the end of the transcript —
  which needs `wasAtTail`, the band check from *before* the resize.
  `VirtualMessageList` mirrors `isAtBottom` into a ref for that, and calls the
  handler ahead of recomputing it.

**One correction is not enough.** A width change reflows every item and a height
change makes the virtualizer render a different number of them; either way it
re-measures over the following passes, so the content end keeps moving after the
first callback. The correction therefore repeats over
`TAIL_REALIGN_RESIZE_CALLBACKS`, a window opened only by a change to the
scroller's own box. Streaming content growth arrives through the same observer
and must never inherit that window — it moves the content end away from a
resting viewport and can never strand it, so reacting to it would be all risk
and no benefit.

Two properties are shared with the gesture path, and one is not:

- **Instant, never animated.** A height change moves the viewport by exactly the
  height that was added or removed, so nothing appears to move at all; the rest
  is a correction the user is already watching happen under the cursor. An
  animation would add a scroll nobody asked for.
- **No transfer of ownership** — unlike the gesture path. A gesture ending in
  the blank says "take me to the end"; a layout change says nothing. The
  browser's clamp never changed who owned the viewport either.

Native scroll anchoring cannot help here: `overflow-anchor: none` is set
throughout the transcript, because it fights the virtualizer.

## An Animation Only as Far as the Reader Can Follow

A jump to latest animates within `FLOWCHAT_ANIMATED_JUMP_MAX_VIEWPORTS` of where
the viewport already is, and lands outright past that. The distance is counted
in viewports, not pixels: what a reader can follow is a share of what they can
see, and the same 2000px is two and a half screens on a laptop and most of one
on a tall display.

**The animation is the affordance, not the movement.** Its job is spatial
continuity — showing which way and how far the viewport went — and three screens
on, the transcript in between goes past faster than anyone can read it. What is
left is a wait where the answer was, which is why every other navigation in the
transcript is instant already.

Distance also costs more than it looks. Animating across N screens of a
virtualized transcript renders and measures every item passed while the
animation runs, and heights are estimates until they are measured — so the
content end moves under an animation aimed at where it used to be, and the
follow loop corrects that afterwards as a second, visible movement.

And past a few screens the animation does not finish. The stand-down below is
bounded, and what it does not cover is delivered as a jump: measured, a jump
issued for 8717px animated 5480 of them and was finished by the loop in a single
3290px write. Two thirds of a scroll and then a jump is worse than either half
alone, and no yield budget fixes it — a longer one only makes the reader wait
through more of an animation they cannot read.

The other `'smooth'` request in `useFlowChatFollowOutput`, the post-streaming
settle, needs no such test: the gap it closes is bounded by `tailHoldMaxGapPx`,
which is at most 60% of one viewport and never larger than the spacer.

`followOutput.jumpBehavior` records the decision and the distance in viewports.
It is also how the constant is checked: if `followOutput.animatedScrollEnded`
still reports a `backstop` reason, an animation ran out its yield without
arriving and the number is too high.

## The Frame Loop Yields to Its Own Animated Scrolls

`applyFollowTarget` assigns `scrollTop` outright, which cancels an in-flight
smooth scroll on the very next frame. Both `'smooth'` requests in
`useFlowChatFollowOutput` — the near jump to latest and the post-streaming
settle — were therefore jumps in practice, so the loop stands down while one
travels.

**What ends the stand-down is the viewport having sat still for
`SMOOTH_SCROLL_STALL_MS`.** That says the animation is over, or was cancelled,
or never started; either way there is nothing left to yield to. Arriving on
target ends it as well, and sooner.

**Neither half of this may be counted in frames, and both were.** A frame count
is not a duration, and the two failures are the same mistake at opposite ends
of the animation:

- The budget was 45 frames — 0.75s at 60Hz, 0.52s on a busy 200Hz display — so
  what a caller bought depended on the machine. The browser scales a smooth
  scroll's duration with its distance; measured, a jump aimed at 8717px animated
  5480 of them and was finished by the loop in a single 3290px write, 38% short.
  A wall-clock budget is what makes that failure the same size everywhere, and
  the distance cap above is what stops anything asking for a jump that size in
  the first place.
- The stall check was then two frames, which is 10ms at 200Hz. A programmatic
  smooth scroll *eases in* — measured, 2px in its first 50ms against 9734px to
  travel — and with scroll offsets quantised to 0.8px the early frames
  genuinely do not move. So the stand-down ended 21ms after it began, having
  animated nothing, and the jump to latest lost its animation entirely.

`SMOOTH_SCROLL_STALL_MS` is therefore derived from the curve's start rather
than from the platform's startup latency, which is the shorter of the two:
visible increments arrive up to ~40ms apart early on, and the constant is that
doubled. `SMOOTH_SCROLL_YIELD_MS` remains as a backstop for an animation that
never ends at all — also a wall-clock fact, and now written as one.

`followOutput.animatedScrollEnded` says which of the three ended it and how far
the animation actually got. Both bugs above were a stand-down ending early, and
both were invisible in the trail: the loop simply started writing, exactly as
it does when an animation finishes properly.

The stand-down ends *by falling through to the write*, not by returning. An
animation aims at the offset it was issued for, and content arrives while it
travels, so the frame that reclaims the viewport is also the frame that covers
whatever grew — one catch-up step rather than one wasted frame and then a
bigger one.

The whole mechanism is *intra-owner* and deliberately outside the register:
this is follow-output yielding to its own animation, and the register
arbitrates between writers rather than inside one. See
`FLOWCHAT_VIEWPORT_REGISTER.md`.

## Footer Contract

The footer below the items holds two independent pieces, and they must stay
separate:

```text
message-list-footer      = current input-stack height + bottom inset + clearance
message-list-tail-spacer = tailSpacerPxForViewport(clientHeight, footer)
```

The footer must not retain an earlier input height or include an estimated card
shrink. The spacer reads the footer to size itself, but the two must not be
folded into one number: the footer is content the transcript clears, the spacer
is range past the end of content, and only the footer is inside the content end.

Footer height represents only the current input-stack layout and real footer
content such as history state and `RuntimeStatusSlot`.

## Known Gaps

- The eased follow raises the scroll-event rate from one a line to one a frame
  while output streams — 1247 of them in one 120-second session, each an anchor
  stand-down and a visible-Turn pass. It does not show in list commits, and
  nothing here counts the DOM reads themselves, so what is actually known is
  that the rendering cost did not move. Re-measure with the `tailFollow` probe
  before changing `TAIL_EASE_ALPHA`.
- Easing is bounded by the frames the display gives it. The step it converges
  on is the content's growth *per frame*, so the same stream smooths less at
  60Hz than on the ~200Hz display these numbers come from, and a fast enough
  stream is a line a frame anywhere — at which point the ease is spending its
  lag and buying nothing.
- `SMOOTH_SCROLL_YIELD_MS` is only a backstop now, but it is still a guess: an
  animation that stalls mid-flight without ever resuming holds the follow off
  for its whole duration. Nothing observed has done that — the stall check ends
  every real animation long before it — and the cost if one did is the follow
  resuming late, not the viewport landing wrong.
- A scrollbar drag is recognised from the gutter the bar occupies, so it is
  invisible where the platform draws overlay scrollbars that take no layout
  width — WebKit-backed builds, where `scrollbar-gutter: stable` reserves
  nothing either. There the drag can still fight the frame loop while output
  streams. Closing it means either a signal that does not depend on the bar
  having a box, or a scrollbar of our own.
- A collapse larger than `tailHoldMaxGapPx` still moves the viewport, by the
  excess only.
- **A reader who scrolls out of the blank and stops at the content end keeps no
  follow.** Output then accumulates below the bottom edge unseen until an
  explicit follow entry takes the viewport again.
- **Paging a long history while still scrolling throws the reading position a
  long way.** Reproduced four times: a session opened on its three-Turn tail
  pages the rest on the first scroll up, the prepend is compensated, and the
  reader keeps wheeling through the settle that follows. Their Turn is out of
  the rendered window for the whole of it, so `captureAnchorForScroll` cannot
  re-capture and carries instead — adding each scroll to the Turn's expected
  offset with no DOM to check the result against. Measured: three attempts,
  5532.7px, an anchor agreed at 112.6px from the viewport top becoming one
  agreed at 3356px in a 985px viewport, and a −1349px correction computed
  against that. Worst case it clamps at `scrollTop: 0` with the session's first
  Turn at the top. `ANCHOR_MISSING_TURN_ATTEMPTS` does not bound it — that is
  frames, not distance.

  **Three fixes were tried and reverted; do not re-derive them.** *Refuse a
  correction whose offset left the viewport* — an anchored offset legitimately
  leaves it, both when the reader scrolls past their own Turn and when a
  registered writer's travel is taken out, and each has a test asserting the
  correction that follows. *Subtract the browser's clamp,*
  `previousScrollTop - max(0, scrollHeight - clientHeight)` — unsound, because
  the previous offset was valid at the previous range, so any shrink at all
  makes it exceed the new maximum whether or not the viewport was ever clamped;
  measured, it took 2790.7px off a descent the reader had made themselves.
  *Track the smallest range since the last credit* — the floor came back equal
  to the current range, so no dip was ever observed. `overflow-anchor` is a dead
  end too: already `none` on every scrolling box here.

  What the four logs do establish: the reader is wheeling continuously
  throughout (the `user-gesture` claims are coalesced, so read `suppressedCount`
  before concluding they stopped), and the descent is largely theirs. The next
  attempt should probably bound the *result* — an offset several screens outside
  the viewport is wrong whatever put it there — rather than try to attribute the
  movement, which is what all three failures had in common.
- An animated scroll aims at the target it was issued for. Jumping to latest
  while output is arriving therefore ends with one catch-up step covering
  whatever content grew during the animation — under the ease's snap threshold
  at ordinary streaming rates, and a visible jump above them.
- A width change anchors the viewport bottom only for a viewport that was at the
  end of the transcript. Everywhere else the reflow moves content out from under
  the bottom edge and nothing puts it back, because the anchor would have to be
  captured before the reflow. Closing this means sampling an element anchor on
  the scroll path.
- On a very short transcript the scrollbar exposes a viewport of empty range.
  The range is intentionally draggable and no longer bounces back.
- The opening reveal has a hard frame cap. A session that pages for longer than
  the cap is revealed mid-settle; raising the cap trades that against a longer
  blank on open.
- **Estimates are still estimates.** A page of history is now reserved per item
  rather than at one scalar, so the range it takes up is close instead of wrong
  by an order of magnitude — but `estimateVirtualMessageItemHeight` cannot know
  how a model round wraps. Corrections shrink; they do not reach zero. And the
  cost of rendering a heavy item is a separate axis: less measurement is forced
  at once, but the work each one costs is unchanged. See
  `FLOWCHAT_VIRTUALIZATION.md`.
- A junction still costs one frame at the first page of a session, measured at
  93px: the commit paints before the settle frame that would correct it. Slower
  frames swallow both and show nothing. Closing it means a tighter estimator,
  not a further correction — the correction already equals the change in the
  scroll range every time it runs.
