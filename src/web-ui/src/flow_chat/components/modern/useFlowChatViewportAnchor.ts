/**
 * The reading position, kept where the reader left it.
 *
 * A virtualizer places items in the scroll range before it knows how tall they
 * are, so every late measurement rewrites the offset of everything below it.
 * react-virtuoso's own correction for that is a scroll by the change in *total*
 * list height, which assumes the change happened above the viewport, and it is
 * gated on scroll direction and on no programmatic scroll being in flight.
 * Measured on a 27-Turn session: one item measuring 38px -> 1003px produced a
 * 965px scroll across a whole Turn, and a 1680px growth that really was above
 * the viewport produced no correction at all — `scrollTop` held at 1133 while
 * `scrollHeight` went 8393 -> 10073, sliding the transcript down by the full
 * amount.
 *
 * So the correction cannot be delegated to whatever is doing the placing. This
 * restores a relationship instead of a delta, which makes it idempotent: when
 * the placement was right the correction is zero, and when it was wrong or
 * never came, this is what makes it right.
 *
 * It is also why capture and restore are separate: the scheme this replaced
 * captured once per prepend, in the commit that changed the item list, which is
 * a frame before the heights it was meant to compensate reach the DOM.
 * Measured corrections over three reproductions: +1, 0, 0.
 *
 * This hook talks to a scroller element and the DOM inside it, and to nothing
 * else. It is deliberately independent of the virtualizer.
