# AGENTS.md

BitFun is a Rust workspace plus React frontends.

Repository rule: **keep product logic platform-agnostic, then expose it through platform adapters**.

## Quick start

1. Read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` before architecture-sensitive changes.
2. For desktop development, prefer `pnpm run desktop:dev` — it provides full hot-reload (Vite HMR + Rust auto-rebuild & restart). Use `pnpm run desktop:preview:debug` only when you need a faster cold-start for frontend-only iteration (Rust changes are not auto-rebuilt).
3. After Rust file changes, prefer `pnpm run fmt:rs` to format only changed or staged `.rs` files. Use `cargo fmt` only when you intentionally want broader formatting coverage.
4. After changes, run the smallest matching verification from the table below.

## Layered Module Index

Dependencies flow top to bottom. A layer may depend on lower layers only; keep
crate dependencies inside each layer to the smallest set needed.

| # | Layer | Path | Owns | Modules / entries | Layer doc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Interfaces and entrypoints | `src/apps/*`, `src/web-ui`, `src/mobile-web`, `BitFun-Installer`, `tests/e2e`, `src/crates/interfaces` | Product hosts, commands, UI entrypoints, protocol interfaces, and cross-surface tests | desktop, CLI, server, relay, Web UI, mobile web, installer, E2E, `acp` | nearest local `AGENTS.md`; [interfaces](src/crates/interfaces/AGENTS.md) |
| 2 | Product assembly | `src/crates/assembly` | Compatibility exports, product capability selection, product-full wiring, and adapter/service registration | `core`, `product-capabilities` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/assembly/AGENTS.md) |
| 3 | Adapters | `src/crates/adapters` | AI/API/transport/WebDriver protocol adapters and external-provider translation | `ai-adapters`, `api-layer`, `transport`, `webdriver` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/adapters/AGENTS.md) |
| 4 | Services | `src/crates/services` | Reusable OS, filesystem, terminal, MCP, remote, git, watch, process, MiniApp runtime IO, and network implementations | `services-core`, `services-integrations`, `terminal` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/services/AGENTS.md) |
| 5 | Execution primitives | `src/crates/execution` | Portable agent, harness, stream, DeepReview policy/report, typed-service, tool-contract, tool-group, and tool-execution building blocks | `agent-runtime`, `agent-stream`, `tool-contracts`, `harness`, `runtime-services`, `tool-provider-groups`, `tool-execution` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/execution/AGENTS.md) |
| 6 | Stable contracts and product domains | `src/crates/contracts` | Shared DTOs, event shapes, runtime ports, and product domain contracts/policies | `core-types`, `events`, `runtime-ports`, `product-domains` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/contracts/AGENTS.md) |

Boundary rules:

- Interfaces and app entrypoints expose selected product behavior; reusable behavior moves down.
- Assembly wires lower layers and selects product capability facts; it must not implement concrete adapter, OS, or service details.
- Adapters translate protocols and external systems; they should not own product capability selection or reusable OS service behavior.
- Services implement reusable concrete OS, process, terminal, MCP, remote, git, filesystem, and MiniApp runtime IO capabilities.
- Execution crates are portable runtime building blocks, not host-specific or delivery-profile owners.
- Contracts stay behavior-light and must not depend upward.


## Common commands

These are command references, not a pre-PR checklist. Use the Verification table
to choose the smallest local precheck; broad suites and builds are mainly for CI
reproduction or build-impacting changes.

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

# Dev
pnpm run desktop:dev               # full hot-reload: Vite HMR + Rust auto-rebuild & restart
pnpm run desktop:preview:debug     # reuse pre-built binary + Vite HMR; no Rust auto-rebuild
pnpm run dev:web                   # browser-only frontend
pnpm run cli:dev                   # CLI runtime

# Check
pnpm run fmt:rs                     # format only changed / staged Rust files
pnpm run lint:web
pnpm run type-check:web
pnpm --dir src/mobile-web run type-check
pnpm run i18n:contract:test          # i18n contract / resources only
pnpm run i18n:audit                  # i18n contract / resources only
pnpm run check:repo-hygiene
pnpm run check:github-config
cargo check --workspace

# Test (prefer focused paths locally; broad suites are CI-backed)
pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run      # broad suite; prefer focused paths locally
cargo test --workspace                  # broad suite; CI-backed

# Build (only for build-impacting changes or CI reproduction)
cargo build -p bitfun-desktop           # build-impacting changes / CI reproduction
pnpm run build:web                      # build-impacting changes / CI reproduction
pnpm run build:mobile-web               # build-impacting changes / CI reproduction

# Fast builds (manual build/debug flows)
pnpm run desktop:build:fast           # debug build, no bundling
pnpm run desktop:build:release-fast   # release with reduced LTO
pnpm run desktop:build:nsis:fast      # Windows installer, release-fast profile
```

## Global rules

### Internationalization

- Locale ids, aliases, fallback rules, and surface defaults are owned by
  `src/shared/i18n/contract/locales.json`. Run `pnpm run i18n:generate`
  after editing it.
- Shared stable labels live in
  `src/shared/i18n/resources/shared/<locale>/terms.json`; workflow copy stays
  in the owning product surface.
- Do not import Web UI locale resources into smaller product surfaces such as
  `src/mobile-web` or `BitFun-Installer`. See `docs/architecture/i18n.md`.
- Static self-contained pages may use generated page-scoped shared-term files;
  they must not import Web UI locale catalogs.
- Web UI loads only bootstrap namespaces eagerly; use `useI18n(namespace)` for
  route or feature copy and keep direct `i18nService.t(...)` calls in bootstrap
  namespaces.
- Use shared i18n formatting helpers for user-visible dates, times, and
  numbers instead of direct `Intl.*` or `toLocale*` calls.
- `pnpm run i18n:audit` enforces key/placeholder parity, direct static key
  existence, dynamic key source proofs, literal fallback and locale-format
  no-growth baselines, shared-term/l10n governance baselines, non-blocking
  same-text locale inventory, and the no-hardcoded-CJK source budget.

### Logging

Logs must be English-only, with no emojis.

- Frontend: [`src/web-ui/LOGGING.md`](src/web-ui/LOGGING.md)
- Backend: [`src/crates/LOGGING.md`](src/crates/LOGGING.md)

### Tauri commands

- Command names: `snake_case`
- TypeScript may wrap with `camelCase`, but invoke Rust with a structured `request`

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn your_command(
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    request: YourRequest,
) -> Result<YourResponse, String>
```

```ts
await api.invoke('your_command', { request: { ... } });
```

### Platform boundaries

- Do not call Tauri APIs directly from UI components; go through the adapter/infrastructure layer.
- Desktop-only host adapters belong in `src/apps/desktop`, then flow back through transport/API layers.
- In shared core, avoid host-specific APIs such as `tauri::AppHandle`; use shared abstractions such as `bitfun_events::EventEmitter`.

### Remote compatibility

- When adding features, consider remote workspace and remote control synchronization support from the start. Local-only behavior can silently leave remote scenarios incomplete.
- If a feature cannot reasonably support remote workspaces, gate it or show a clear unsupported-state message instead of letting it fail with a generic error.

### Agent loop behavior

- Do not add hard-coded limits or pattern checks to the agent loop as a first response to looping behavior, such as blocking repeated tool calls by string or count alone.
- Excessive hard-coding turns the agent loop into a brittle workflow engine. Investigate the root cause first: tool behavior, model interaction, session context packaging, prompt/tool schema design, or state synchronization issues.

## Architecture

### Core decomposition guardrails

For any `bitfun-core` decomposition, feature-boundary, dependency-boundary, or
Rust build-speed refactor, read
[`docs/architecture/core-decomposition.md`](docs/architecture/core-decomposition.md)
before editing. Keep this file as an entry point; put module-specific ownership
details in the nearest module `AGENTS.md`.

Repository-level decomposition rules:

- Do not confuse DTO/contract extraction with runtime owner migration.
- Product surfaces may diverge; share stable facts or ports, not UI, protocol,
  lifecycle, or platform implementation.
- Moving runtime ownership requires a reviewed port/provider design, old-path
  compatibility, behavior equivalence tests, and explicit confirmation when a
  behavior boundary could change.

## Verification

Run the smallest local precheck that matches the touched files. CI is expected to
cover full builds and broad test suites; run heavier local commands only when the
change directly affects build, packaging, or CI cannot protect the path.

| Change type | Minimum verification |
|---|---|
| Frontend UI, state, or adapters without i18n resource/contract changes | `pnpm run type-check:web`, plus the nearest focused test when behavior changed |
| Locale resource-only changes | `pnpm run i18n:audit` |
| Locale contract or shared terms | `pnpm run i18n:generate && pnpm run i18n:contract:test && pnpm run i18n:audit` |
| Web UI i18n runtime, namespace loading, or direct `i18nService.t(...)` usage | `pnpm run i18n:contract:test && pnpm run type-check:web && pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/infrastructure/i18n/core/I18nService.test.ts` |
| Mobile web UI, state, pairing, disconnect, or reconnect behavior | `pnpm --dir src/mobile-web run type-check`; include manual pairing / reconnect notes when behavior changes |
| Shared Rust logic in `core`, `transport`, `api-layer`, adapters, or services | `cargo check --workspace`, plus the nearest focused `cargo test` when behavior changed |
| Desktop integration, Tauri APIs, browser/computer-use, or desktop-only behavior | `cargo check -p bitfun-desktop`, plus focused desktop tests when behavior changed |
| Behavior covered by desktop smoke/functional flows | Prefer the nearest focused E2E/smoke check; rely on CI for broad build/test coverage unless build behavior changed |
| `src/crates/adapters/ai-adapters` | Relevant Rust checks above; add `cargo test -p bitfun-agent-stream` only when stream contracts changed |
| Installer frontend or i18n runtime without packaging changes | `pnpm --dir BitFun-Installer run type-check` |
| Installer Tauri/Rust changes | `cargo check --manifest-path BitFun-Installer/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` |
| Installer packaging, payload, install/uninstall flow, or native bundling | `pnpm run installer:build` |

## Agent-doc priority

Prefer the nearest matching `AGENTS.md` / `AGENTS-CN.md` for the directory you are changing. If local guidance conflicts with this file, follow the more specific, nearer document.
