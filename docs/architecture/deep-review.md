# DeepReview / Strict Review Architecture

## Scope

DeepReview is the compatibility runtime for `Review: Strict`, the highest-strength mode of the unified Review experience. It remains implemented as a child-session workflow that runs a configurable read-only reviewer set against a review target, but it should not be presented as a second ordinary product entry next to Review.

Product-facing guardrails live in [review-verify-implementation-guardrails.md](../sdlc-harness/review-verify-implementation-guardrails.md):

- `Review` is the primary user-facing entry.
- `/review` is the intended long-term command entry; `/DeepReview` is only a transitional typed compatibility command for historical strict-review launches.
- `ReviewTeam` is an internal strict-review reviewer-set configuration, not a separate product concept users must learn.
- PR Review consumes Review results and future readiness projections; it must not own another reviewer executor.

The current implementation has three layers:

- Frontend launch and UI orchestration in `src/web-ui`.
- Platform adapter commands in `src/apps/desktop/src/api/agentic_api.rs`.
- Platform-agnostic runtime policy, task admission, queue state, retry metadata, and report enrichment in `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic`.

The launch adapter is currently desktop-only. Browser/server surfaces hide every Review launch action, including fix follow-up retry, and reject typed Review commands with a clear unsupported-state message until the server owns the same session, Git-target, and policy command contracts; existing review attempts remain viewable. Adding only one RPC method to the current ping-only server would not make the workflow functional. The Review settings route remains visible for navigation compatibility on those surfaces, but renders a read-only desktop-only state and never loads or saves desktop capacity settings.

The platform-neutral L1-L3 Review decision is owned by `src/crates/contracts/product-domains/src/review.rs`. Desktop exposes it through `decide_review_quality`; frontend surfaces pass raw target facts and consume the decision instead of owning another threshold table. L0 completion checks and Verify evidence are intentionally outside the production contract until the separate Verify exploration defines a trustworthy evidence source.

The backend does not resolve the review target or build the launch manifest. The frontend resolves target facts, asks the product-domain policy for a quality decision, and builds the effective `ReviewTeamRunManifest` for L2/L3. The prepared prompt and manifest are reused unchanged for consent and execution. The manifest, session kind, agent type, storage keys, and queue event names stay compatible with historical DeepReview sessions.

## Runtime Roles

`CodeReview` and the `DeepReview` orchestrator are read-only adversarial review identities. `CodeReview` handles L1 and can run inline as one isolated Task when a normal coding request explicitly asks for a careful review. That inline check stays in the current task, uses an anonymized collapsed progress card, and cannot silently expand into multiple reviewers. Broader L2/L3 execution remains in the unified Review launch so scope and cost confirmation stay visible. `DeepReview` can launch only manifest-approved reviewers, inspect repository evidence, and submit the consolidated report; it has no edit, command, Git-mutation, or remediation tools.

`src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/agents/definitions/review/review_specialists.rs` defines read-only reviewer agents:

- `ReviewBusinessLogic`
- `ReviewPerformance`
- `ReviewSecurity`
- `ReviewArchitecture`
- `ReviewFrontend`
- `ReviewJudge`

The reviewer agents use instruction-only context and read/search/diff tools. They do not receive the generic Git tool because it also exposes mutating operations. `ReviewFrontend` is a conditional role. `ReviewJudge` validates reviewer evidence and consistency instead of performing a full independent review pass.

`ReviewFixer` is the separate writable remediation identity. DeepReview runtime policy rejects it during review execution. The frontend action surface invokes it only after user approval, and a new read-only Review run checks the fix when requested.

## Launch Flow

Review can be launched from session-file controls or `/review`. The product-domain decision chooses L1, L2, or L3 from target facts and intent. `/review strict` explicitly requests L3. Historical `/DeepReview` and `/deepreview` inputs remain compatibility aliases that route into the same L3 path.

Frontend launch code lives in `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/deep-review/launch`:

- `commandParser.ts` identifies canonical `/review strict` commands, transitional `/DeepReview` compatibility aliases, and optional file or git targets.
- `targetResolver.ts` resolves slash-command targets from git status, changed files, and diffs when a workspace is available. File-scoped sizing reads untracked content through the registered, remote-aware workspace API; a resolved non-empty target with unknown change size cannot select L1.
- `launchPrompt.ts` formats the user-facing launch prompt.
- `DeepReviewService.ts` builds the review-team manifest, creates a child session, sends the launch prompt, and inserts the parent-session summary marker. Launch does not automatically open the auxiliary pane; the summary-card detail action is the normal user-facing way to inspect the background review run.
- `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/services/DeepReviewService.ts` is a compatibility re-export.
- `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/services/ReviewService.ts` owns the unified prepared plan and launches either one read-only CodeReview child or the existing DeepReview child runtime.
- Fix follow-up uses the same service to re-evaluate the union of the original review files and files directly changed by `ReviewFixer`. If command, Git, or stdin tools can produce changes that cannot be attributed safely, the UI explicitly falls back to the current workspace diff instead of claiming a narrower scope. It remeasures the selected diff before obtaining a new decision and consent, then opens one fresh isolated reviewer child in the existing auxiliary pane. The fixer baseline and exact selected remediation ids are persisted before remediation starts, so restart restores only unfinished items from the original selection. The follow-up reservation stores the same request id later written to the existing child relationship metadata and used to derive the backend session id. Restart reconciles a created child, while an uncertain or incomplete launch keeps the reservation retryable with the same id. Backend creation returns an existing session only when the immutable identity (`agent_type`, relationship kind, parent session, and parent request) matches; mutable parent turn location does not break retries. This early-return path is restricted to Review/DeepReview child relationships with a parent request, so ordinary explicit-id session restoration keeps its existing coordinator rebuild behavior. The action bar distinguishes retry, in-progress, completed, failed, cancelled, and view states instead of leaving a permanently disabled button. A metadata-only historical child is opened and hydrated before terminal state is inferred; lack of loaded turns is not treated as permission to launch a duplicate. Scope, changed-file records, and the final child id stay in session metadata so restart does not widen scope or duplicate a known run. Older sessions without recoverable scope explicitly notify the user before falling back to the current workspace diff.

`launchDeepReviewSession` creates a child session with:

- `sessionKind: 'deep_review'`
- `agentType: 'DeepReview'`
- tools enabled
- safe mode enabled
- auto-compaction enabled
- context compression enabled
- `deepReviewRunManifest` stored on the child session metadata

If launch fails after the child session is created, the frontend runs idempotent UI/session cleanup, deletes the backend session when possible, discards local session state, and reports cleanup issues with the launch error.

## Strict Reviewer Configuration

The default strict reviewer configuration contract is mirrored in Rust and TypeScript.

Rust source:

- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/team_definition.rs`
- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review_policy.rs`
- `src/apps/desktop/src/api/agentic_api.rs`

Frontend source:

- `src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/defaults.ts`
- `src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/types.ts`
- `src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/index.ts`

The desktop command `get_default_review_team_definition` returns the backend default definition. The frontend normalizes that response and falls back to its TypeScript default if the command is unavailable.

The persisted config path is `ai.review_teams.default`. The frontend config shape includes:

- extra subagent ids
- review strategy level
- per-reviewer strategy overrides
- reviewer and judge timeouts
- reviewer file-split threshold
- max same-role instances
- max retries per role
- max parallel reviewers
- max queue wait seconds
- provider capacity queue enablement
- bounded auto-retry enablement and elapsed guard

Extra reviewers must be enabled subagents with read-only review tooling. Core reviewers, `DeepReview`, and `ReviewFixer` are disallowed as extra reviewers.

## Manifest Shape

`buildEffectiveReviewTeamManifest` in `src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/index.ts` builds the launch manifest. The manifest has `reviewMode: 'deep'` and may include:

- workspace path
- policy source
- target classification
- final strategy level
- scope profile
- frontend and backend strategy recommendations
- strategy decision
- execution policy
- concurrency policy
- change stats
- pre-review summary
- evidence pack
- shared-context cache plan
- incremental-review cache plan
- token-budget plan
- active core reviewers
- quality-gate reviewer
- enabled extra reviewers
- skipped reviewers
- work packets

The target classifier drives conditional reviewer selection. `ReviewFrontend` is included only when the target matches frontend-oriented files.

The evidence pack is metadata-only. It lists changed file paths, aggregate diff stats, domain/risk tags, packet ids, hunk hints, contract hints, and budget counts. It explicitly excludes source text, full diff text, model output, provider raw bodies, and full file contents.

## Strategies and Scope

The product-domain decision owns the selected Review level and strategy. The frontend owns strategy profile text and converts the selected strategy into manifest planning in `src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/strategy.ts` and `scopeProfile.ts`.

Supported strategy levels are `quick`, `normal`, and `deep`.

- `quick` uses high-risk-only scope, zero dependency hops, risk-matched optional reviewers, and no broad tool exploration.
- `normal` uses risk-expanded scope, one dependency hop, configured optional reviewers, and no broad tool exploration.
- `deep` uses full-depth scope, policy-limited dependency context, full optional reviewer policy, and broad tool exploration.

L2 manifests cap all active reviewers at three, prioritize target-relevant roles, and omit the judge to control token and latency. L3 manifests keep the full applicable reviewer set and judge. The portable runtime validates the structural invariants carried by `qualityDecision`: L2 requires `normal`, at most three active reviewers, and no quality gate; L3 requires `deep`, every non-conditional core reviewer, `ReviewJudge` as the quality gate, and each conditional core reviewer must be active or explicitly `not_applicable`. Manifests without `qualityDecision` retain historical compatibility. The backend also parses the selected strategy from the manifest/config and uses it for runtime guardrails such as timeouts, policy classification, and retry limits. Legacy frontend/backend recommendation fields remain report metadata and do not replace the product-domain decision.

The launch consent token estimate sums the manifest heuristic for every planned work packet, including the judge, instead of multiplying the largest reviewer packet by the call count. The per-reviewer maximum remains a separate prompt-limit guardrail. Historical manifests without the total estimate use the older per-call fallback and keep the estimate explicitly approximate.

## Work Packets

`src/web-ui/src/shared/services/review-team/workPackets.ts` creates pure launch-plan metadata. Work packets do not inspect file contents and do not make runtime retry or queue decisions.

Each work packet includes:

- packet id
- phase (`reviewer` or `judge`)
- launch batch
- subagent id and labels
- assigned scope
- allowed tools
- timeout seconds
- required output fields
- strategy level and directive
- model slot

If the included file count exceeds the reviewer file-split threshold and same-role instances are allowed, reviewer scopes are split into module-aware groups. Reviewer packets are then assigned launch batches using the concurrency policy. The judge packet, when present, runs in the batch after the final reviewer batch.

## Backend Policy and Admission

`DeepReviewExecutionPolicy` in `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/execution_policy.rs` parses runtime policy from config and classifies subagent launches.

Allowed DeepReview runtime launches are:

- core reviewer roles
- conditional reviewer roles when active in the manifest
- configured extra reviewer roles
- `ReviewJudge`

Rejected launches include:

- `ReviewFixer` during review execution
- nested `DeepReview`
- any subagent not configured for the review team
- subagents skipped or absent from the run manifest

`DeepReviewRunManifestGate` in `manifest.rs` reads active subagent ids from `workPackets`, `coreReviewers`, `enabledExtraReviewers`, and `qualityGateReviewer`. It also records skipped reviewer reasons so policy failures can explain why a reviewer is inactive.

## Task Execution and Queue State

The generic `Task` tool is adapted for DeepReview in:

- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/tools/implementations/task_tool.rs`
- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/task_adapter.rs`
- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/queue.rs`
- `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/budget.rs`

DeepReview task execution uses the manifest and tool context to:

- identify reviewer role and packet id
- attach incremental review cache data
- enforce policy and retry coverage
- cap active reviewers
- preserve launch-batch ordering
- wait for transient capacity when allowed
- emit queue state events
- record runtime diagnostics and capacity skips

Queueable capacity reasons are:

- `provider_rate_limit`
- `provider_concurrency_limit`
- `retry_after`
- `local_concurrency_cap`
- `launch_batch_blocked`
- `temporary_overload`

Queue states are:

- `queued_for_capacity`
- `paused_by_user`
- `running`
- `capacity_skipped`

Queue wait time is tracked separately from reviewer run time. Paused and queued time does not consume reviewer timeout.

The desktop command `control_deep_review_queue` validates `sessionId`, `dialogTurnId`, and `toolId`, then applies one of:

- `pause`
- `continue`
- `cancel`
- `skip_optional`

Pause, continue, and cancel are scoped to a specific turn and tool id. `skip_optional` is turn-scoped.

## Runtime Events

Queue state events are defined in `src/crates/contracts/events/src/agentic.rs` as `AgenticEvent::DeepReviewQueueStateChanged`.

The frontend listens through `AgentAPI.onDeepReviewQueueStateChanged` on `agentic://deep-review-queue-state-changed`. The TypeScript event shape mirrors the Rust event fields:

- tool id
- subagent type
- queue status
- optional reason
- queued reviewer count
- optional active reviewer count
- optional effective parallel instances
- optional optional-reviewer count
- optional queue/run elapsed time
- optional max queue wait
- session concurrency flag

`src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/utils/deepReviewQueueStateEvents.ts` applies queue events only to `deep_review` sessions.

## Report Submission

Review results are submitted through `submit_code_review` in `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/tools/implementations/code_review_tool.rs`.

In DeepReview context, the tool requires the deep-review fields in addition to the standard summary/issues/positive-points shape:

- `review_mode`
- `review_scope`
- `reviewers`
- `remediation_plan`

DeepReview report enrichment lives in `src/crates/assembly/core/src/agentic/deep_review/report.rs`. It fills missing reviewer packet metadata when a unique packet can be inferred, adds runtime diagnostics, updates incremental cache data, and adds reliability signals for cache hits, cache misses, partial coverage, capacity skips, retry guidance, queue waits, reduced scope, and evidence-pack metadata.

Report enrichment is guarded by the tool context. Standard Code Review output should not receive DeepReview-only metadata unless the active tool context proves `agent_type == 'DeepReview'`.

## Frontend Report and Action UI

DeepReview report rendering lives under `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/deep-review/report` and is consumed by `CodeReviewToolCard`.

The action surface is shared with standard Code Review but includes DeepReview-specific phases and capacity state:

- `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/store/deepReviewActionBarStore.ts`
- `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/components/btw/BtwSessionPanel.tsx`
- `src/web-ui/src/flow_chat/deep-review/action-bar`

`BtwSessionPanel` detects `sessionKind === 'deep_review'`, reads the latest code-review result, derives interrupted DeepReview state, restores persisted action-bar state, and renders `ReviewActionBar`.

The action bar can show:

- capacity queue notice and inline controls
- partial results
- recovery plan preview
- remediation item selection
- needs-decision gate
- fix, independently review fixes, resume, and retry controls

The action bar dispatches queue controls through `agentAPI.controlDeepReviewQueue` when backend queue-control identifiers are available. Otherwise it falls back to local/session-stop-only behavior exposed by the store.

## Persistence

The DeepReview child session stores `deepReviewRunManifest` in frontend session state, session metadata, and history metadata. The backend also reads `deep_review_run_manifest` from tool context/session metadata when a DeepReview tool call needs manifest data.

The review action bar persists UI state separately through `ReviewActionBarPersistenceService` so historical review sessions can restore visible remediation progress without rerunning the review.

## Boundary Rules

- Frontend components do not call Tauri directly; they use infrastructure APIs such as `agentAPI`.
- Shared core stays platform-agnostic and uses event/config/tool abstractions instead of Tauri handles.
- Product domains own the platform-neutral L1-L3 Review decision; the frontend owns target resolution, team manifest construction, strategy profile wording, prompt-block construction, consent, and action UI.
- The backend owns policy validation, runtime admission, queue/retry state, event emission, and report enrichment.
- Reviewer subagents and review orchestrators stay read-only. Remediation runs under `ReviewFixer` after user approval, not during the reviewer pass.
- Work packets and evidence packs are planning metadata; they must not embed file contents or full diffs.

## Change Checklist

When changing DeepReview behavior, update all affected contracts together:

- Backend constants, team definition, execution policy, manifest gate, task adapter, queue events, and report enrichment.
- Frontend strict-review defaults/types, manifest builder, prompt block, launch service, action-bar store, event mapping, report rendering, and locales.
- Desktop Tauri command DTOs when capacity controls or default review definition contracts change.
- Tests near the touched module, especially policy tests, strict-review manifest tests, queue event tests, launch tests, action-bar tests, and locale completeness tests.
