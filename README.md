## Local AI Workbench Built Around the Code Agent

BitFun is a local AI workbench built around a Code Agent designed for long-horizon tasks, engineering execution, and token economy.

It can understand complex context, call tools, wait for results, correct deviations, and keep long-horizon tasks moving until they reach a deliverable state. Coding, research, office work, documents, desktop operations, and extensible workflows all happen in the same local desktop environment.

The core goal is direct: move AI from one-off task execution into a productivity system that can work over long periods.

## Agent Core Metrics

The data below evaluates BitFun's core Agent capabilities. All measurements use **Deepseek-V4-Pro** and focus on task completion, KV Cache reuse, and large-repository search efficiency.

BitFun leads Open Code and Claude Code on both **SWE-Bench-Pro** and **SWE-Bench-Verified**. SWE-Bench-Pro focuses on complex software engineering, while SWE-Bench-Verified focuses on human-verified GitHub issue fixes.

![Agent benchmark scores](./png/agent_benchmark_scores.svg)

The current numbers are BitFun's initial evaluation results, with each case run once. We will keep optimizing and release full benchmark details later. Benchmark references: [SWE-Bench-Pro](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/swe_bench_pro_public) / [SWE-Bench-Verified](https://www.swebench.com/verified.html)

Whether Agent execution is economical depends on whether repeated context can be reused reliably. In the same SWE-Bench-Pro evaluation round, BitFun's average KV Cache hit rate was **98.67%**. Across 728 valid cache records, **83.1%** of trials reached a hit rate of at least 98%, and **51.8%** reached at least 99%. On the token side, Cached Input accounted for **98.71%**, while Uncached Input (scaled) accounted for **1.29%**.

Agents also need to retrieve context repeatedly. For large-repository retrieval, BitFun uses **flashgrep** to reduce search time by up to about **94.6%** in huge repositories such as Chromium, with an average speedup of about **36.1x**.

## One Desktop, Five Agent Workflows

| Workflow | What it solves |
| --- | --- |
| **Code** | A Code Agent for real repositories: Agentic, Plan, Debug, testing, review, Deep Review, and continuous iteration. |
| **Research** | Collect context, compare sources, summarize findings, and produce structured conclusions, reports, or follow-up actions. |
| **Cowork** | Handle PDF / DOCX / XLSX / PPTX, writing, rewriting, summarization, layout, and office collaboration. |
| **Operate** | Use Computer Use to operate browsers and desktop apps, completing flows such as clicking, typing, navigating, waiting, and confirming. |
| **Extend** | Connect MCP, install Skills, define Markdown Agents, generate Mini Apps, and continue reshaping BitFun itself. |

## Customize Your BitFun

BitFun's extension paths progress continuously from light to deep customization:

| Tier | Path | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | Markdown Agent | Defining roles, flows, constraints, and tool bundles. |
| **L2** | MCP / Skills | Connecting external tools, professional capabilities, and workflows. |
| **L3** | Mini App | Generating dedicated interfaces, forms, panels, or visualizations for tasks. |
| **L4** | Source-level customization | Changing tools, adapters, UI, Runtime, or product shape. |

You can use BitFun's Code Agent to extend BitFun itself.
